# Moon
From Project WIKI
### General Information
The **Moon** is Earth's only natural satellite and is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System. The moon formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after Earth. The most widely accepted reasoning for the Moon's existence is that the Moon formed after a Mars-sized planet named Theia collided with Earth and debris merged together into the Moon.
#### Physical Parameters
The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching. One of the Moon's most prominent geological features is the impact of craters on the surface. The Moon, as seen below, has an extemely weak atmosphere and is therefore unable to break up any incoming asteroids through the atmosphere burning them up.

#### Atmospheric Parameters
The Moon's atmosphere is so tenuous as to be nearly a vacuum, with a total mass less than 10 tonnes. The Hade Co. Fargo™ Initiative aims to create a breathable atmosphere on the Moon.
#### Observation and Exploration
The Moon has been observed by humans since humans came into existence, however the first documentation of the Moon was found as a rock carving in Ireland 5000 years ago. The Moon's cycles led to the understanding of astronomical objects being circular. 
##### 20th Century
The Cold-War inspired Space Race between the Soviet Union and United States led to an acceleration of interest in exploration of the Moon. Major pushes towards spaceflight and space technology were made by each country in order to get to the Moon, with the first man in space being achieved by the Soviet Union. After the failure of the Apollo programme by the United States, putting humans on the Moon was deemed too ambituous of a task to fulfill. 
##### 21st Century
Interest on putting humans on the Moon piqued again during the 2010s as China and the United States fell into another Cold War. After China put their first drone onto the Moon, the United States launched a new Apollo programme. NASA expects to put humans on the moon by 2022, however Hade Co. has announced initiatives to do so by this year.
#### Legal Status
The Moon remains unclaimed by any nation. Russia, China, India and the United States are bound to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which defines the Moon and the rest of Outer Space as 'province of all mankind'.-
