# Mars
From Project WIKI
### General Information
**Mars** is the fourth planet from the sun. The planet is named after the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.
The days and seasons are similar to Earth's, which is the reasoning behind the idea of it becoming a 'second Earth' through terraforming. Hade Co. is the main backer behind this idea.
#### Physical Parameters
Mars is approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity.
#### Atmospheric Parameters
Mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes, so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30 Pa (0.030 kPa) on Olympus Mons to over 1,155 Pa (1.155 kPa) in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600 Pa (0.60 kPa).
#### Habitability and Search for Life
Currently the Fargo Initiative under Hade Co. is the only programme that talks of long-term human occupating on Mars. Mars is far from being a new home for humans. Mars's soil has been theorised to be inarable and its atmosphere is also theorised to be unsuitable for humans due to the absence of a magnetosphere (see above). The surface of the planet is also extremely cold, and the planet lacks the amount of water that Earth has. Mars contains water at its polar caps which has been theorised to act as a water supply for any Mars colonies.
