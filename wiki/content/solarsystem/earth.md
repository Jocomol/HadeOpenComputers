# Earth
From Project WIKI
### General Information
**Earth** (or 'the Overworld') is the third planet from the sun and is currently the only known celestial body to harbour life, being home to hundreds of species including 7.7 billion humans. Earth has been approximated to have formed over 4.5 billion years ago, with the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite forming shortly after.
#### Physical Parameters
The shape of the Earth is nearly spherical, there are flattenings at the poles and bulging at the equator, making Earth more of an 'oblate spheroid'. Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg).It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulphur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.

#### Atmospheric Parameters
The atmosphere is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%. Earth's atmosphere has been observed to be heating up, and is largely attributed to human interference through carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere largely by the burning of fossil fuels.
